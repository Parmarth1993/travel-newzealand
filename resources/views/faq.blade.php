                     <h4>Why do I need a travel advisor?</h4>
                     <p>Why spend countless hours researching and reserving when you can have someone else do it at no extra charge? Travel advisors can save you money based on their supplier relationships while also saving you time and effort. With any product 4-star and above, it’s always best to book through an agency, as a travel advisor can get you the best deals with extra perks and benefits. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="faqin">
                     <h4>Does it cost money to use a travel advisor? </h4>
                     <p>There is no cost to the client for our services. Nor are the prices higher because of our commissions. When booking your own travel, you don't really know what you are getting until you arrive. We have carefully selected our accommodation providers to make sure you get the most value for money. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="faqin">
                     <h4>Can I fly economy? </h4>
                     <p>Air tickets booked by Travel New Zealand will be Business or First Class. If clients want to fly economy, we can assist with it, but it’s usually cheaper for them to book economy tickets themselves. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="faqin">
                     <h4>How long does it take to get there? </h4>
                     <p>It is a lot quicker to get to New Zealand than you think. With direct flights from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, Chicago and New York, your flight will take between 12-17 hours.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="faqin">
                     <h4>Is New Zealand safe? </h4>
                     <p>New Zealand is a very safe country to visit. However, theft from tourists can be a relatively common occurrence. Most theft happens from break-ins of parked vehicles. If you are parking your vehicle, especially in a remote area, hide your important belongings (such as cash and travel documents). As for dangerous creatures, New Zealand has no snakes, ticks, scorpions, poisonous spiders or anything else considered scary. The one thing you really do want to be careful about is the weather, which can change very quickly. Always be prepared when venturing out into the wilderness away from shelter. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="faqin">
                     <h4>How much time will I need?</h4>
                     <p>The recommended trip length is 14-21 days, but ask most people who visit and they will simply answer "more." New Zealand may look small but it is packed with a large variety of scenery and activities. Our suggested itineraries are designed to give you the best experience possible for your time frame without feeling rushed. 
                     </p>

                  <div class="faqin">
                     <h4>Is New Zealand expensive?</h4>
                     <p>It depends on how comfortably you like to travel. New Zealand is an island nation separated from the rest of the world, so a lot of our products need to be imported which raises the price. Depending on which country you live in, you may well have an excellent exchange rate so the price difference may work out favorably.

                     <h4>How far will I drive each day?</h4>
                     <p>No one wants to be stuck in a car all day while on vacation, so we have designed our itineraries to have you driving from 1hr to 4 hrs when changing location. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="faqin">
                     <h4>What is it like to drive around? </h4>
                     <p>New Zealand drives on the left side of the road. Don't let this deter you—it's easier than you think. New Zealand's diverse terrain means roads are often narrow, hilly and windy. Outside of the main cities, there are very few motorways. Most of our roads are single lanes in each direction without barriers in between. You may also encounter gravel roads. </p>

                  <div class="faqin">
                     <h4>Do I need a special driver’s permit? </h4>
                     <p>You can legally drive in New Zealand for 12 months if you have either a current full driver’s licence from your home country in the English language or an International Driving Permit.  You must carry your licence or permit at all times when driving and you are only able to drive the same types of vehicles you are licensed to drive in your home country. </p>

                   <div class="faqin">
                     <h4>Do I need a Visa?</h4>
                     <p>Visitors from visa-waiver countries must request an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) prior to coming to New Zealand. Click on the link to see if your passport qualifies for an ETA. You may also have to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL). For more information on the ETA and IVL, visit Immigration New Zealand.</p>

                     <h4>What is the weather like?</h4>
                     <p>New Zealand is home to a temperate climate with high sunshine hours and moderate rainfall. Much of the country lies near the coast, which means mild temperatures. The average temperature decreases as you travel south; January and February are the warmest months with July being the coldest month of the year.

                     <h4>How far in advance should I book? </h4>
                     <p>We recommend booking 3-4 months in advance, although we can book up to a few weeks before your departure date. Our peak season runs from October through to April. During this period, it is strongly recommended that you book any tours, events, accommodation and transport ahead of time to ensure availability. Outside of these months there is less need to book in advance, except in ski resort towns such as Queenstown and Wanaka. </p>

                     <h4>When is the best time to visit? </h4>
                     <p>New Zealand's peak season is during its summer months (December, January, February, March), during which prices are higher. Flights are more expensive around the Christmas/New year period. New Zealand is beautiful all year round, with each season providing different landscapes and opportunities.  </p>
